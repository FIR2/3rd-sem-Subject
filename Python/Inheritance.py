# Benefits of inheritance are: 

# It represents real-world relationships well.
# It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
# It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.
# Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure. 
# Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.
